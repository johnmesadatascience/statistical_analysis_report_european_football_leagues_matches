New metrics have come into play to measure the performance of the teams, two of these new metrics are Expected Goals (xG) and Passes Allowed Per Defensive Action (PPDA). 
Expected Goal is a metric that assesses every chance that a player or a team has to score a goal. 
PPDA is calculated by dividing the number of passes allowed in the attacking half by the number of defensive actions taken such as interceptions, tackles, and fouls.

This means that a PPDA of 10 is when a team allowed the opposition to play 10 passes without any defensive intervention. 
PPDA metric measures the pressure or defensive intensity of a team and the lower PPDA the pressure the team has.

The purpose of this project is to verify if the lower PPDA the more expected goals (xG) the team will have.
